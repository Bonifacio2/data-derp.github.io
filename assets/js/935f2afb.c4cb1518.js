While they functionally do the same things, Kinesis is an alternative to Kafka: it\'s not interoperable but uses the same concepts that Kafka has but with slightly different namings. For example, partitioning in Kafka is called sharding on Kinesis. Amazon has very recently come up with Amazon MSK (managed streaming for Apache Kafka). At the time of writing, with AWS customers, Kinesis is still much more popular service so far.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"beyond-the-batch/cloud-offerings-aws":{"id":"beyond-the-batch/cloud-offerings-aws","title":"Cloud Offerings: AWS","description":"Amazon Kinesis","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"beyond-the-batch/cloud-offerings-azure":{"id":"beyond-the-batch/cloud-offerings-azure","title":"Cloud Offerings: Azure","description":"Azure Event Hubs","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"beyond-the-batch/exercise":{"id":"beyond-the-batch/exercise","title":"Exercise: Real World Structured Streaming","description":"Follow instructions here to get started.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"beyond-the-batch/exercise-kafka-optional":{"id":"beyond-the-batch/exercise-kafka-optional","title":"Exercise: Apache Kafka (Optional)","description":"Apache Kafka can be deployed to both on-premise and cloud environments which makes it an interesting player in the enterprise data space.
