While they functionally do the same things, Kinesis is an alternative to Kafka: it\'s not interoperable but uses the same concepts that Kafka has but with slightly different namings. For example, partitioning in Kafka is called sharding on Kinesis. Amazon has very recently come up with Amazon MSK (managed streaming for Apache Kafka).
